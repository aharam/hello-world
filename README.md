# hello-world

My name is Ahmad. This is my 4th time trying to teach myself how to code/program. I started when I was 16 with Java, but never really figured it out. I gave up on the idea while I was in college and focused on my Industrial Eng. degree. When I graduated the idea of Data Science seemed appealing to me, so I tried to teach myself some Python to no avail. I simply didn't have the time. Or I didn't wan to commit the time. 7 years have passed. In that time I started anad sucessfully created 4 businesses in the fitness world, but I still never felt fulfilled. I took the year 2020 off to travel and try to figure out what it was I wanted to do. Well we all know how 2020 has gone, and I found myself stuck in Beirut, Lebanon with my mom. Don't get me wrong, if there's anywhere I'd want to be stuck in during a worldwide pandemic, it's Beirut with my mom. So things turned out ok, but I found myself with a lot of time on my hands, so I reopened the idea of Data Science. I found some useful tutorials and applications online and I've been doing 4-5 hours a day. My goal is to finally accomplish this task. Now here I am, trying to figure out Github.
